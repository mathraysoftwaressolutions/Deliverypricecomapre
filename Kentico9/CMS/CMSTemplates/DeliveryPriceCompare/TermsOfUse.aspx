Founded with the aim of solving a problem and hoping to change the perception of the delivery and removal industry, we always knew we wanted to be different.<br/><br/>

Despising the lacklustre customer service commonly associated with moving, we made a conscious decision to focus on you, our customers. With a vibrant and colourful attitude toward our new process of delivery and removals, we began the AnyVan story, with a very small team in a very small London office.

Five years on, and over 1.2 million users later, we're continuing to grow our team whilst breaking new ground in the world of delivery and removals. By injecting life and colour into a once grey and dreary industry, we have proceeded to light the AnyVan flame that has literally blown away the dismal past and with open arms, welcomed a brighter future.<br/><br/>
